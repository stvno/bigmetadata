Gini Index
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Gini index, or index of income concentration, is a statistical measure of income inequality ranging from 0 to 1. A measure of 1 indicates perfect inequality, i.e., one household having all the income and rest having none. A measure of 0 indicates perfect equality, i.e., all households having an equal share of income.





Measure "Gini Index"  for one point:


.. code:: postgresql


  




  UPDATE {table_name}
    SET {new_numeric_column} =
      OBS_GetMeasure(
        CDB_LatLng(40.7, -73.9),
        'us.census.acs.B19083001'
      );






Gini Index is only available for point lookups.
